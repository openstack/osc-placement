    Support is added for the `1.14`_ placement API microversion by adding
    the ``root_provider_uuid`` and ``parent_provider_uuid`` to the output of
    resource provider list/show/create/set commands. Also resource provider
    create/set commands now have a new option ``--parent-provider <UUID>``.
    And ``resource provider list`` has a new option ``--in-tree <UUID>``.
