    The ``openstack resource provider allocation set`` command now supports
    microversion `1.8`_. Specifically from 1.8 it is necessary to specify
    ``--user-id`` and ``--project-id`` arguments when setting allocations.

    The ``openstack resource usage show`` command is
    available starting from microversion `1.9`_. It is possible to
    show usages for a project and user.

    See the command documentation for `allocation set`_ and
    `resource usage show`_ for more details.
