    A new ``openstack resource provider allocation unset`` command has been
    added which allows removing allocations against specific resource providers
    for the given consumer. This can be useful when a consumer has allocations
    against more than one resource provider and
    ``openstack resource provider allocation delete`` is undesirable as it
    removes all allocations for the consumer. The new unset command requires
    ``--os-placement-api-version 1.12`` or greater.
