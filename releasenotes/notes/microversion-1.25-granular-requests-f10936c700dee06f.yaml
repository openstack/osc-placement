    The ``openstack allocation candidate list`` command now supports
    ``--group`` and ``--group-policy`` option. The ``--group`` option accepts
    an integer to group granular requests. If specified, following given
    options of resources, required/forbidden traits, and aggregates are
    associated to that group and will be satisfied by the same resource
    provider in the response. ``--group`` can be repeated to get candidates
    from multiple resource providers in a same resource provider tree.
    If multiple groups are supplied, the separate groups may or may not be
    satisfied by the same provider. If you want the groups to be satisfied by
    different resource providers, set ``--group_policy`` to ``isolate``.
    For example::

      openstack allocation candidate list \
          --group 1 --resource VCPU=3 --required HW_CPU_X86_SSE \
          --group 2 --resource VCPU=4 \
          --group_policy isolate

    This option is available with ``--os-placement-api-version 1.25`` or
    greater, but to have placement server be aware of nested providers, use
    ``--os-placement-api-version 1.29`` or greater.

    See the `REST API Version History`__ for more details.
