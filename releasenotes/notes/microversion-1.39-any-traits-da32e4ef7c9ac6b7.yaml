    Both the ``openstack resource provider list`` and
    ``openstack allocation candidate list`` command now supports
    ``--os-placement-api-version 1.39`` where the ``--required`` argument now
    can contain a comma separated list of trait names to express OR
    relationship. So ``--required T1,T2 --required T3`` means
    (T1 or T2) and T3.
