    microversion `1.5`_. Specifically it is possible to delete all inventories
    of the specified resource provider.

upgrade:
  - |
    The ``resource_class`` positional argument in command
     ``openstack resource provider inventory delete`` was replaced with the
     ``--resource-class`` optional argument. The ``--resource-class`` option
     is still required if using ``--os-placement-api-version`` less than
     1.5.
