    The ``openstack resource provider allocation unset`` command now supports
    ``--resource-class`` option, which accepts string of a resource class.
    This will remove allocations for the given resource class from all the
    providers. If ``--provider`` option is also specified, allocations to
    remove will be limited to the given resource class of the given resource
    provider.

    example1::

        # remove VGPU allocation from provider P for this consumer.
        allocation unset <consumer_uuid> --provider P --resource-class VGPU

    example2::

        # remove VGPU allocations from all providers for this consumer.
        allocation unset <consumer_uuid> --resource-class VGPU
