    The ``openstack resource provider list`` command now supports microversion
    `1.3`_ and `1.4`_. Specifically two new options are added to the command:

    * ``--aggregate-uuid``: List resource providers which are members of at
      least one of the specified resource provider aggregates.
    * ``--resource``: List resource providers which have the capacity to serve
      allocation requests for the given amount of specified resource class.

    See the `command documentation`__ for more details.
