features:
  - |
    The ``openstack allocation candidate list`` and the ``openstack resource
    provider list`` command now supports ``--member-of`` option, which
    accepts comma-separated UUIDs of the resource provider aggregates. If this
    is specified, the returned resource providers must be associated with at
    least one of the aggregates identified by uuid.
    This option can be repeated to add(restrict) the condition with
    ``--os-placement-api-version 1.24`` or greater.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``--aggregate-uuid`` option has been deprecated for the ``openstack
    allocation candidate list`` and the ``openstack resource provider list``
    commands. Please use ``--member-of`` option instead.
